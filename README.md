# Patterns for React

What is a pattern?
A pattern describes a problem that appears over and over again in different ways and give us a solution to solve it, this solution can be implemented multiple times but is the same solution at the core. 

For example, think of a bridge as a way to connect to pieces of land, it can be short engough and a simple wood board will sufice by contrast the two pieces of land can be too far appart and the solution will be a bigger bridge with other types of material like the Golden Gate Bridge, note that the problems are similiar and so the solutions but the implementation is at different scales.
