# Composition

## The problem
Often times we find that a component have a lot of code for structure and style, this can produce very long components full of HTML code with little to none possibility of reuse. In this scenario composition can be very helpful.


## The solution
Composition is a technique used to split your code into more concrete components instead of having a big one that does multiple things and them use this components together to achive the original goal.

## Consequences
After separating the components into more concrete parts, now is easy to re-use this new created components as well as replacing them.
